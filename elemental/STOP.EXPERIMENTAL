DANGER! DANGER!

Elemental is experimental. It will change rapidly, both because the HTML5 IDLs are evolving, and because
some things like the Collection class APIs will most likely be changed. If you use elemental, be prepared to
have your app broken, and to contribute by giving feedback and/or patches.
